**Hi, I'm Louis!** I'm a technical AI safety researcher and recent Oxford MCompSciPhil graduate from Hertford College.

------------------------

## Some things about me

- I'm primarily interested in *AI control* protocols, *chain-of-thought monitoring*, and *scheming evals*.
  - My previous work includes elements of game theory, multi-agent risks, corrigibility, and active learning.

- Aside from academic work, I'm pretty musical: I play bass in a couple bands, noodle on guitar and keys when writing my own music, and secretly would love to make a career out of playing music.

- Some of my loves include games and puzzles of all varieties, continental philosophy, Japanese food (part of my heritage), Arsenal FC, and most of all my lovely fiancée :\)

- *Shoot me an email if you want to talk* - I'm super responsive! Get in touch via louis\[at\]cbthomson\[dot\]com
